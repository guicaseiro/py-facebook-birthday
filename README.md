It's a simple automation with Seleniun to send congratulations to your friends in Facebook. Probably you forgot the birthday of some friend, then with this script you 'll never forgot anymore.

I recommend to use other libary if you'll run in some server, called Schedule. Your funcionality is run your script as you programming (by months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and etc..) and i counsel to use the "day" option to send congratulations
